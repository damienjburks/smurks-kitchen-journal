# 👋🏾 About Smurks Kitchen Journal

Hi there — we’re **Damien** and **Eboni**, the duo behind _Smurks Kitchen Journal_.

This site is our digital kitchen table — a warm and welcoming place to capture the meals we’ve made, the flavors we love, and the memories that come with them. It’s part recipe collection, part food diary, and fully us.

## 🌿 Why We Created This

Like a lot of folks, we found joy in the little things: Sunday dinners, random weeknight experiments, and revisiting meals that bring us comfort. But the notes were everywhere — in our phones, texts, old journals, half-written on sticky notes.

We wanted one place to collect and revisit those stories.  
And so, **Smurks Kitchen Journal** was born.

## 🍳 What You’ll Find Here

- Recipes that we've cooked, loved, and perfected over time
- A few cooking tips and notes from our own trial & error
- Dishes inspired by family traditions, personal favorites, and everyday cravings
- Categories like **Comfort Food**, **Healthy Eats**, and **Italian Food** — with more to come!

This isn’t a food blog filled with ads or sponsored content.  
It’s a _living journal_ — and you’re welcome here anytime.

## ✨ What “Smurks” Means

> “Smurks” is our nickname — a blend of our names, our bond, and the little smirks we give each other when a dish turns out just right.

We hope this journal inspires you to get in the kitchen, try something new, and create memories of your own.

**Thanks for visiting.**  
With love and leftovers,  
**Damien & Eboni**
