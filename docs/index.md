# Welcome to Smurks Kitchen Journal

Welcome to our digital recipe heaven — a journal filled with the meals we love, the stories behind them, and the flavors that bring us joy. Curated by **Damien & Eboni** with :heart:, _Smurks Kitchen Journal_ is a cozy, evolving space for comfort food, experiments, and everyday eats.

Whether it’s a simple weeknight curry, a sweet treat we perfected together, or a holiday favorite passed down through family — it lives here.

## 🌿 What You’ll Find

- **✨ Homemade Recipes**  
  Every recipe is written with love — and often tested late at night with jazz in the background and two curious cats at our feet.

- **📝 Personal Notes & Tips**  
  We include the “real talk” behind the meals: what we’d tweak next time, how we substitute ingredients, and the stories that make each dish ours.

- **🍲 Cozy Categories**  
  From breakfast to dessert, vegan to comfort food — find recipes by category, tag, or vibe.

## 💌 Why We Built This

We wanted something more personal than a recipe site and more structured than a notebook. Smurks Kitchen Journal is our way of:

- Documenting our culinary life together
- Sharing our favorites with friends, family, and anyone who loves food
- Exploring the joy of cooking in a way that’s honest and accessible

Made with 💚, leftovers, and a little bit of spice —  
**Damien & Eboni**
