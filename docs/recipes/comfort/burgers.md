## Ingredients

### Produce

- 2 stalks organic lettuce
- 2 heirloom tomatoes
- 1 yellow onion

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep the Fries

1. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
2. Cut russet potatoes into thin strips.
3. Toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
4. Arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet.
5. Bake for 30–40 minutes, flipping halfway, until crispy.

### Step 2: Bake the Bacon

1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or foil.
2. Lay bacon slices flat, without overlapping.
3. Bake at 400°F (204°C) for 15–20 minutes, until crispy.
4. Transfer to a paper towel–lined plate.

### Step 3: Make the Burger Patties

1. Season ground beef with salt and pepper.
2. Form into 6 equal-sized patties.
3. Press a small indentation in the center of each patty to prevent puffing.

### Step 4: Cook the Burgers

2. In the last minute of cooking, top each patty with Colby Jack cheese.
