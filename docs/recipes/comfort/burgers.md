## Ingredients

### Produce

- 2 stalks Organic Lettuce
- 2 Heirloom Tomatoes
- 1 Yellow Onion
- 4 large Russet Potatoes

### Pantry

- Olive Oil
- Salt & Pepper

### Dairy

- 6 slices Colby Jack Cheese

### Protein

- 36 oz Organic Beef (85% lean, 15% fat)
- 1 pack Applewood Bacon

## Instructions

1. **Prep the Fries:**

   - Preheat oven to 425Â°F (220Â°C).
   - Cut the russet potatoes into thin strips.
   - Toss them in olive oil, salt, and pepper.
   - Arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake for 30â€“40 minutes, flipping halfway until crispy.

2. **Bake the Bacon:**

   - Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or foil.
   - Lay the bacon slices flat, without overlapping.
   - Bake in the oven at 400Â°F (204Â°C) for 15â€“20 minutes, or until crispy.
   - Transfer cooked bacon to a paper towel-lined plate.

3. **Make the Burger Patties:**

   - Season the beef with salt and pepper.
   - Form into 6 equal-sized patties.
   - Make a small indentation in the center of each patty to prevent puffing during cooking.

4. **Cook the Burgers:**

   - Grill or cook the patties in a skillet over medium-high heat for about 4â€“5 minutes per side (or until desired doneness).
   - In the last minute of cooking, place a slice of Colby Jack cheese on each patty and cover to melt.

5. **Prepare the Toppings:**

   - Slice heirloom tomatoes and onions.
   - Rinse and dry the lettuce leaves.

6. **Assemble the Burgers:**
   - Place each patty on a bun (if using).
   - Top with bacon, lettuce, tomato, and onion.
   - Serve immediately with crispy fries on the side.

### ðŸ’¡ Notes

- You can toast the buns with a little butter for extra flavor.
- Optional: Add condiments like ketchup, mustard, or aioli.
- For extra crispy fries, soak potato slices in cold water for 30 minutes before baking.
