## Overview

✨ Sweet, spicy, and irresistibly cheesy!

Meet your new favorite pizza night upgrade — the “Bee Sting.” This pizza pairs classic pepperoni and melty mozzarella with tangy marinara, fresh veggies, and a drizzle of chili-infused hot honey for a perfect sweet-heat balance. Crispy on the edges and gooey in the center, each slice is finished with creamy ranch for dipping. Once you make it at home, you’ll never miss delivery again.

This meal is inspired by [HelloFresh], which we originally used to make this in the past.
