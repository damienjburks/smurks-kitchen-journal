## Ingredients

### Produce

- 6 sweet potatoes
- 24 oz broccoli
- ¾ cup panko breadcrumbs

### Pantry

- 3 tbsp Fry Seasoning
- Olive oil
- Salt & pepper

### Dairy

- 12 tbsp sour cream
- 1.5 cups cheddar cheese
- 6 tbsp butter

### Protein

- 36 oz chicken breasts

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep & Boil Sweet Potatoes

1. Adjust racks to top and middle positions and preheat oven to 425°F.
2. Peel and dice sweet potatoes into ½-inch pieces.
3. Place sweet potatoes in a medium pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches.
4. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.
5. Drain and return to pot, keeping covered until ready to mash.

### Step 2: Prep Chicken & Broccoli

1. In a small bowl, combine panko, cheddar cheese, half the Fry Seasoning, olive oil, salt, and pepper.
2. Pat chicken dry and season with salt, pepper, and remaining Fry Seasoning.
3. Place chicken on a baking sheet and brush with half the sour cream.
4. Evenly top with panko-cheddar mixture, pressing to adhere.
5. On a second baking sheet, toss broccoli with olive oil, salt, and pepper.

### Step 3: Roast

1. Place chicken on the middle rack and broccoli on the top rack.
2. Roast 15–20 minutes, until chicken is cooked through (165°F internal) and broccoli is browned and tender.
   - **Tip:** Broccoli may finish before chicken. Remove if done earlier.

### Step 4: Mash Sweet Potatoes

1. Mash sweet potatoes with butter, remaining sour cream, and salt.
2. For extra sweetness, add a pinch of brown sugar or drizzle of honey if desired.

### Step 5: Serve

1. Divide mashed sweet potatoes, roasted broccoli, and cheddar-crusted chicken between plates.
2. Serve hot and enjoy!

## Notes

- Add a squeeze of lemon over broccoli for brightness.
- Try swapping cheddar for Monterey Jack or Parmesan for a flavor twist.
- Toast leftover panko mix in a skillet to use as a crunchy topping for veggies.
