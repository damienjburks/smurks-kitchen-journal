## Ingredients

### Produce

- 24 oz broccoli (cut into bite-size florets)

### Pantry

- 4.5 oz buttermilk ranch dressing
- 2 demi baguettes
- 2 tbsp Fry Seasoning
- 6 tbsp garlic herb butter
- ¾ cup panko breadcrumbs
- Olive oil
- Salt & pepper
- 1 large oven-ready baking tray

### Dairy

- 9 tbsp Parmesan cheese

### Protein

- 30 oz chicken cutlets

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep

1. Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to **425°F**.
2. Wash and dry produce.
3. In a medium bowl, combine panko, Fry Seasoning, Parmesan, olive oil, salt, and pepper.

### Step 2: Coat & Bake Chicken

1. Lightly coat the oven-ready tray with nonstick spray or oil.
2. Pat chicken dry and season with salt and pepper.
3. Brush each cutlet with a thin layer of sour cream or oil (optional for adherence).
4. Mound with the panko-Parmesan mixture, pressing gently to adhere (no need to coat the bottom).
5. Place chicken in the tray and bake for **15–20 minutes**, until golden and cooked through (165°F internal).

### Step 3: Cook Broccoli

1. Cut broccoli into bite-size pieces if needed.
2. Place in a microwave-safe bowl with salt, pepper, and a splash of water.
3. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave until crisp-tender, 2–3 minutes.
4. Carefully remove plastic wrap (watch for steam!) and toss with **half the garlic herb butter**.

### Step 4: Make Garlic Bread

1. Halve baguettes lengthwise and toast lightly in the oven.
2. Spread with remaining garlic herb butter.
3. Slice each half diagonally before serving.

### Step 5: Serve

1. Divide chicken, broccoli, and garlic bread between plates.
2. Serve with buttermilk ranch dressing on the side for dipping.

## Notes

- Chicken is fully cooked when it reaches **165°F** internal temperature.
- Swap broccoli for green beans or asparagus for variety.
- For extra crunch, broil chicken for 1–2 minutes at the end.
