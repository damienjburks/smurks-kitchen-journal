## Ingredients

### Produce

- 3 red onions
- 12 oz pineapple (fresh or canned, drained)
- 3 poblano peppers
- ¾ oz cilantro

### Pantry

- 15 tsp red wine vinegar
- 12 tbsp BBQ sauce
- 6 flatbreads
- Olive oil
- Cooking oil
- Salt & pepper

### Dairy

- 12 oz fresh mozzarella (diced into ½-inch pieces)
- ¾ cup Monterey Jack cheese

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep Ingredients

1. Preheat oven to 450°F. Place a foil-lined baking sheet on the top rack to heat (use two sheets if needed).
2. Wash and dry produce.
3. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion. Drain pineapple, reserving juice.
4. In a small bowl, combine ¼ of the onion, half the vinegar, and a pinch of salt with reserved pineapple juice. Set aside to quick-pickle.

### Step 2: Cook the Onion & Pineapple

1. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium heat.
2. Add remaining onion and cook until softened, 6–8 minutes, adding splashes of water to prevent sticking.
3. Meanwhile, halve, core, and thinly slice poblano into strips. Toss in a bowl with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
4. Increase heat to medium-high. Add pineapple and a drizzle of oil to the pan with onions. Cook 2–3 minutes until lightly browned.
5. Stir in remaining vinegar and cook 1–2 minutes more, until onion and pineapple are caramelized and jammy. Season with salt and pepper.

### Step 3: Assemble Flatbreads

1. Remove hot baking sheet from oven.
2. Brush each flatbread with olive oil.
3. Spread evenly with BBQ sauce.
4. Top with caramelized onion and pineapple, poblano strips, Monterey Jack, and mozzarella.

### Step 4: Bake & Finish

1. Return flatbreads to oven and bake 10–12 minutes, until cheese melts and edges are golden.
   - For multiple trays, swap positions halfway through.
2. Transfer flatbreads to a cutting board.
3. Drain pickled onion and sprinkle over flatbreads with fresh cilantro.
4. Slice, divide, and serve hot.

## Notes

- Add cooked chicken or sausage if you’d like a protein boost.
- Swap Monterey Jack for cheddar for a sharper flavor.
- Drizzle with extra BBQ sauce before serving for more tang.
