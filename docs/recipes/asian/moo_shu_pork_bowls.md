## Overview

These Moo Shu Pork Bowls are a fast, flavorful take on the classic Chinese dish—no pancake wraps required. Ground pork is stir-fried with red cabbage, scallions, and a tangy hoisin-soy glaze, then served over buttery jasmine rice. Finished with a sprinkle of sesame seeds, scallion greens, and fresh lime, each bite delivers sweet, savory, and slightly spicy satisfaction.
