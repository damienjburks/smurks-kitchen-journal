### Step 1: Prep Ingredients & Char Cabbage

- Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

- Add pork ramen stock, chicken stock concentrate, and 6½ cups water.
- Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Simmer for 2–4 minutes until slightly thickened.
- Season with salt and pepper to taste.

### Step 4: Cook Noodles & Assemble

- Once water is boiling, add ramen noodles and cook for 1–2 minutes until tender.
- Drain and rinse under cold water for 30 seconds.
- Divide noodles between bowls.
- Pour pork broth mixture over noodles.
- Top with charred cabbage, scallion greens, remaining sesame seeds, and chili flakes to taste.
