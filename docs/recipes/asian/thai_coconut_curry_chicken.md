## Overview

This recipe proves that flavorful, homemade curry can be just as easy as a weeknight stir-fry. Chicken breast strips and bell peppers are seared and then simmered in a rich coconut milk curry spiked with sweet Thai chili sauce and lime. Once thickened, the curry is ladled over fluffy jasmine rice with lime zest and fresh cilantro for a vibrant finish.

Inspired by our original [HelloFresh] meal kit experience, this one remains a favorite in our dinner rotation.

## Ingredients

### Produce

- 3 Bell Peppers (sliced into strips)
- ¾ oz Cilantro (minced)
- 3 Chili Peppers (thinly sliced)
- 3 Limes (zested and quartered)

### Pantry

- 1.5 cups Jasmine Rice
- 5.5 oz Chicken Stock or 1 concentrate
- 3 oz Sweet Thai Chili Sauce
- 3 tbsp Butter
- 3 tsp Sugar
- Vegetable Oil
- Salt & Pepper

### Dairy

- 2 cups Coconut Milk (unsweetened)

### Protein

- 30 oz Chicken Breast Strips

## Instructions

### Step 1: Cook the Rice

In a small pot, combine:

- 1.5 cups jasmine rice
- ¾ cup water (1½ cups for 4 servings)
- Pinch of salt

Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook for 15–18 minutes until tender. Remove from heat and keep covered until ready to serve.

### Step 2: Prep the Ingredients

While rice cooks:

- Wash and dry produce
- Dice bell peppers into 1" pieces
- Zest and quarter the limes
- Mince cilantro
- Thinly slice chili peppers
- Pat chicken dry with paper towels

### Step 3: Sauté the Peppers

Heat a large drizzle of oil in a pan over medium-high heat.  
Add bell peppers and a pinch of salt.  
Cook for ~5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

### Step 4: Brown the Chicken

To the same pan, add:

- Chicken breast strips
- Another drizzle of oil
- Big pinch of salt

Cook for 3–4 minutes until lightly browned (they’ll finish cooking later).  
Stir in **half the curry powder** (or all for larger servings), and cook for 1 minute.

### Step 5: Make the Curry

Shake the coconut milk before opening.  
Stir into the pan:

- ⅔ cup coconut milk (1⅓ cups for 4 servings)
- Thai chili sauce
- Chicken stock concentrate
- Juice from half a lime
- 1 tsp sugar (2 tsp for 4 servings)

Simmer over medium-low for 4–6 minutes until the sauce thickens, peppers are tender, and chicken is cooked through.  
Season to taste with salt and additional lime juice if desired.

### Step 6: Finish & Serve

Fluff rice with a fork and stir in:

- Lime zest
- Half the cilantro
- 1 tbsp butter (2 tbsp for 4 servings)
- Salt & pepper

Serve rice in bowls, top with curry chicken, remaining cilantro, and a pinch of chili. Add lime wedges on the side.

> **Poultry Safety Tip:** Chicken is fully cooked when it reaches an internal temperature of **165°F**.
