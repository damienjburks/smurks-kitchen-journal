## Overview

This recipe proves that flavorful, homemade curry can be just as easy as a weeknight stir-fry. Chicken breast strips and bell peppers are seared and then simmered in a rich coconut milk curry spiked with sweet Thai chili sauce and lime. Once thickened, the curry is ladled over fluffy jasmine rice with lime zest and fresh cilantro for a vibrant finish.

Inspired by our original [HelloFresh] meal kit experience, this one remains a favorite in our dinner rotation.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Cook the Rice

1. In a small pot, combine:
   - 1.5 cups jasmine rice
   - 2 1/4 cups water
   - Pinch of salt
2. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer.
3. Cook 15–18 minutes until tender. Remove from heat and keep covered until ready to serve.

### Step 2: Prep the Ingredients

2. Dice bell peppers into 1" pieces.
3. Zest and quarter limes.
4. Mince cilantro.
5. Thinly slice chili peppers.

### Step 3: Sauté the Peppers

1. Heat a large drizzle of vegetable oil in a large pan over medium-high heat.
2. Add bell peppers and a pinch of salt.
3. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes until slightly softened.

### Step 4: Brown the Chicken

1. To the same pan, add:
   - Chicken breast strips
   - Another drizzle of oil
   - Big pinch of salt
2. Cook 3–4 minutes until lightly browned (they will finish cooking later).
3. Stir in half the curry powder (or all for larger servings). Cook 1 minute until fragrant.

1. Fluff rice with a fork and stir in:
   - Lime zest
   - Half the cilantro

   - Salt & pepper to taste

## Notes

- Swap chicken with shrimp, tofu, or chickpeas for a protein variation.
- For extra heat, add more chili peppers or a spoonful of red curry paste.
- Light coconut milk may be used for a lower-calorie option.
- **Poultry Safety Tip:** Chicken is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches **165°F**.
