## Overviews

If you're craving a rich and savory pasta dish that’s full of umami flavor, this one’s for you. Al dente penne is tossed in a decadent truffle cream sauce loaded with sautéed mushrooms, diced tomatoes, and scallions. A sprinkle of toasted garlic panko and freshly grated Parmesan adds just the right amount of crunch and saltiness to each bite.

This meal is inspired by [HelloFresh], which is what we originally used to make this in the past.
