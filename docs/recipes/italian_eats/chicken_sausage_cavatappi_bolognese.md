## Ingredients

### Produce

- 3 medium zucchinis
- 3 medium yellow onions

### Pantry

- 18 oz cavatappi pasta
- 4.5 oz tomato paste
- 3 tbsp butter
- 1 tbsp olive oil (plus extra for roasting)
- 3 tbsp Italian seasoning
- 3 tsp sugar
- Salt & pepper

### Dairy

- Â¾ cup Parmesan cheese
- 6 tbsp sour cream

### Protein

- 27 oz Italian chicken sausage

## Instructions

1. **Prep the veggies**

   - Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 450Â°F.
   - Wash and dry produce. Trim and halve zucchinis lengthwise; cut into Â½-inch half-moons. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion.

2. **Roast the zucchini**

   - Toss zucchini on a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil, half the Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.
   - Roast until browned and tender, 14â€“16 minutes, tossing halfway. Tent with foil to keep warm.

3. **Cook the pasta**

   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
   - Add cavatappi and cook until al dente, 9â€“11 minutes. Reserve 1Â½ cups pasta water, then drain.

4. **Cook the aromatics & sausage**

   - Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high.
   - Add onion, salt, and pepper; cook until softened, 5â€“6 minutes.
   - Add sausage, breaking up into pieces, and cook until browned, 3â€“4 minutes.

5. **Build the sauce**

   - Stir in tomato paste and remaining Italian seasoning; cook until fragrant, ~1 minute.
   - Add reserved pasta water, sugar, salt, and pepper. Simmer until slightly thickened and sausage is cooked through, 2â€“3 minutes.
   - Stir in sour cream and butter until smooth and creamy.

6. **Finish the pasta**

   - Stir in drained pasta, roasted zucchini, and half the Parmesan until combined.
   - Add splashes of pasta water as needed until sauce coats pasta.

7. **Serve**
   - Divide pasta between bowls. Sprinkle with remaining Parmesan and serve warm.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- Add red pepper flakes for heat.
- Swap cavatappi for rigatoni, penne, or fusilli.
- Stir in an extra knob of butter before serving for added richness.
