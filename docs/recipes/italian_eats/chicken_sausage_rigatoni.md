## Overview

We consider pasta night a holidayâ€”one that we like to celebrate at least once a week, if not more. If you agree, youâ€™re in luck. This dish has it all: al dente rigatoni, sautÃ©ed bell pepper, and flavorful chicken sausage, all tossed in a mouthwatering, creamy pink sauce. Of course, the festivities wouldnâ€™t be complete without a generous sprinkle of Parmesan. Now, let the carb celebrations commence!

This meal is inspired by [HelloFresh], which we originally used to make this in the past.
