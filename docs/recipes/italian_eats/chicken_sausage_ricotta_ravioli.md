## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep the Ingredients

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
2. Wash and dry produce.
3. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.
4. Quarter lemons.

### Step 2: Cook the Sausage

1. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat.
2. Add sausage, scallion whites, and Italian seasoning.
3. Cook, breaking up sausage into pieces, until browned and scallions are softened (3–5 minutes).
4. Stir in half the crushed tomatoes and simmer for 1–2 minutes. Turn off heat.

### Step 3: Boil the Ravioli

1. Once water is boiling, add ravioli to the pot.
2. Reduce heat to a gentle simmer and cook until ravioli are al dente and floating (4–5 minutes).
3. Reserve ½ cup of pasta water, then drain and set aside.

### Step 4: Build the Sauce

1. Return the pan with sausage to low heat.
2. Add chicken stock concentrate, a squeeze of lemon juice, and a splash of pasta cooking water.
3. Simmer until sausage is fully cooked and sauce is slightly thickened (1–2 minutes).
4. Turn off heat and stir in sour cream and 1 tbsp butter until smooth.
5. Season with salt, pepper, and additional lemon juice to taste.
6. Adjust consistency with a bit more pasta water if needed.

### Step 5: Combine & Serve

1. Gently toss ravioli into the sauce until evenly coated.
2. Divide between plates or bowls.
3. Garnish with scallion greens and serve with lemon wedges on the side.

## Notes

- Use mild or spicy sausage depending on your preference.
- Add crushed red pepper flakes for heat or extra Parmesan for richness.
- For a lighter twist, swap sour cream for Greek yogurt.
