## Overview

If you love a saucy bowl of pasta packed with roasted goodness, this dish is for you. Tender penne is tossed with caramelized bell pepper, juicy tomatoes, and savory roasted garlic â€” all coated in a creamy, herb-infused tomato sauce that hugs every bite. Finished with a sprinkle of Parmesan, this cozy bowl is equal parts comforting, flavorful, and photo-worthy.

This meal is inspired by [EveryPlate], which is what we originally used to make this in the past.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep & Roast

- Preheat oven to **400Â°F** and adjust rack to the middle.
- Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
- Wash and dry all produce.
- Slice bell pepper and cut tomatoes.
- Place garlic cloves on a small foil square, drizzle with oil, season with salt & pepper, and wrap into a foil packet.
- Toss bell pepper + tomatoes on a baking sheet with oil, salt, and pepper. Add foil garlic packet to the same sheet.
- Roast for **18â€“20 minutes**, until veggies are browned and tender.

### Step 2: Cook the Chicken

- Pat chicken dry and season with salt and pepper.
- In a large pan, heat a drizzle of oil over medium-high.
- Cook chicken, stirring occasionally, until fully cooked through (**4â€“6 minutes**).
- Transfer to a plate and set aside.

### Step 3: Boil the Pasta

- Once water is boiling, add penne and cook until **al dente**, **9â€“11 minutes**.
- Reserve **1 cup** of pasta water, then drain. Keep the pot.

### Step 4: Build the Sauce

- Remove roasted garlic from foil and mash with a fork until smooth.

- Add **Â½ cup reserved pasta water**, **veggie stock**, **cream cheese**, and a pinch of salt. Whisk until smooth.
- Add pasta, roasted veggies, and butter. Toss to coat.
- Stir in **half the chicken**, adding more pasta water if needed for creaminess.

### Step 5: Serve

- Top with remaining chicken and **Parmesan cheese**.
- Serve hot and enjoy!

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- You can substitute chicken with steak or just eat this with just veggies.
- For extra kick, add a pinch of red chili flakes to the sauce.
- Try a homemade Italian seasoning blend or pick one up from Sprouts or Tom Thumb.

> ðŸ§ª **Poultry Safety Tip**: Chicken is fully cooked when the internal temperature reaches **165Â°F**.
