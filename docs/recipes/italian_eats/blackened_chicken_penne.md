## Overview

This pasta may break the rules, but it does so deliciously. Instead of taking the traditional Italian route, we’re mixing things up with bold Southwestern flair. Strips of juicy chicken breast are coated in smoky blackening spices and pan-seared to perfection. Poblano peppers and Roma tomatoes add freshness and texture, while a luscious Monterey Jack and cream cheese sauce wraps around every bite of penne like a cozy blanket. It’s a fun and flavorful twist on creamy pasta night that’s sure to be a crowd-pleaser.

This recipe is inspired by [HelloFresh], which we originally used to make this at home.
