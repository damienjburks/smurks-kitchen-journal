## Overview

When life gives you lemons... you could make lemonade. But wouldnâ€™t you rather whip up a delectable homemade pasta limone?

This rich, tangy, oh-so-easy sauce comes together in a flash with lemon zest and juice, Parmesan, butter, and creamâ€”plus toasted garlic and sautÃ©ed zucchini. Itâ€™s all tossed with penne pasta and golden seared chicken breast strips, then finished with herbs and extra Parm. A little squeeze of lemon on top adds the perfect finishing touch.

Inspired by [HelloFresh], this dish is a zesty comfort classic.
