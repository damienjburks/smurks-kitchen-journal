## Overview

This recipe transforms the classic sausage-and-pepper hoagie into a crispy, cheesy flatbread masterpiece. Instead of a roll, golden flatbreads are toasted and topped with a smooth tomato-butter sauce, sautéed peppers and onions, crumbled sausage, and two kinds of cheese. Quick to make, fun to share, and absolutely satisfying.

Inspired by [HelloFresh], which we originally used to make this in the past.

## Ingredients

### Produce

- 3 yellow onions (cut into ½-inch wedges)
- 3 long green peppers (sliced into ½-inch rings)

### Pantry

- 6 flatbreads
- 4.5 oz tomato paste
- 6 tbsp butter
- 9 tsp olive oil
- Salt & pepper

### Dairy

- 1.5 cups mozzarella cheese
- ¾ cup Monterey Jack cheese

### Protein

- 27 oz Italian chicken sausage

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep & Roast Veggies

1. Adjust oven rack to top position. Preheat oven to 450°F.
2. Wash and dry produce.
3. Halve, peel, and cut onions into ½-inch wedges.
4. Core, deseed, and slice peppers into ½-inch rings.

### Step 2: Toast Flatbreads

1. Place flatbreads on a lightly oiled baking sheet.
2. Toast on the top rack for 5–7 minutes, until golden.
3. (If using two baking sheets, rotate halfway through for even toasting.)

### Step 3: Cook Veggies & Sausage

1. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat.
2. Add onion, pepper, salt, and pepper. Cook for 6–8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and browned.
3. Transfer veggies to a plate.
4. In the same pan, heat another drizzle of oil.
5. Remove sausage from casings (if needed) and cook, breaking up meat, until browned and cooked through, 4–6 minutes.

### Step 4: Make Tomato-Butter Sauce

1. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine ¾ cup water and 6 tbsp butter.
2. Microwave until hot and melted, about 1 minute.
3. Whisk in tomato paste until smooth.
4. Season with salt and pepper.

### Step 5: Assemble & Bake Flatbreads

1. Spread toasted flatbreads with the tomato-butter sauce.
2. Top evenly with mozzarella, Monterey Jack, sausage, and veggie mixture.
3. Season lightly with salt and pepper.
4. Bake for 3–5 minutes, until cheese is melted and edges are crisp.

### Step 6: Finish & Serve

1. Let flatbreads cool slightly before slicing.
2. Divide between plates and serve warm.

## Notes

- Italian sausage is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches **160°F**.
- Use naan or pita if flatbreads aren’t available.
- Add crushed red pepper or chili flakes for extra heat.
