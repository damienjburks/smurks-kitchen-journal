## Overview

This recipe transforms the classic sausage-and-pepper hoagie into a crispy, cheesy flatbread masterpiece. Instead of a roll, golden flatbreads are toasted and topped with a smooth tomato-butter sauce, sautÃ©ed peppers and onions, crumbled sausage, and two kinds of cheese. Quick to make, fun to share, and absolutely satisfying.

Inspired by [HelloFresh], which we originally used to make this in the past.

## Ingredients

### Produce

- 3 medium yellow onions
- 3 medium green peppers

### Pantry

- 6 flatbreads
- 4.5 oz tomato paste
- 6 tbsp butter
- 9 tsp olive oil
- 3 tsp sugar
- Salt & pepper

### Dairy

- 1.5 cups mozzarella cheese
- 3/4 cup Monterey Jack cheese

### Protein

- 27 oz Italian chicken sausage

## Instructions

1. **Prep & roast veggies**

   - Adjust oven rack to top position (top and middle for 4 servings). Preheat oven to 450Â°F.
   - Wash and dry produce. Halve, peel, and cut onions into Â½-inch wedges. Core, deseed, and slice peppers crosswise into Â½-inch rings.

2. **Toast flatbreads**

   - Place flatbreads on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Toast on the top rack until golden, 5â€“7 minutes. (For 4 servings, divide between 2 sheets and toast on top and middle racks.)

3. **Cook veggies & sausage**

   - Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add onion, pepper, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and softened, 6â€“8 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
   - In the same pan, add another drizzle of oil. Remove sausage from casings (if needed) and cook, breaking into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4â€“6 minutes.

4. **Make tomato-butter sauce**

   - In a microwave-safe bowl, combine 3/4 cup water with 6 tbsp butter.Microwave until hot and melted, about 1 minute.
   - Whisk in tomato paste until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.

5. **Assemble & bake flatbreads**

   - Spread toasted flatbreads with sauce. Top evenly with mozzarella, Monterey Jack, sausage, and veggies. Season with salt and pepper.
   - Bake until cheese is melted and flatbreads are golden, 3â€“5 minutes.

6. **Finish & serve**
   - Let flatbreads cool slightly before slicing.
   - Divide between plates and serve hot.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- Italian sausage is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches **160Â°F**.
