- Salt & pepper
- 1 large oven-ready baking tray
- 4.5 oz buttermilk ranch dressing

### Protein

- 30 oz chopped chicken breast

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep & Assemble

1. Preheat oven to 425°F. Adjust rack to the middle position.

3. In the oven-ready tray, combine chopped chicken, rice, chicken stock concentrate, Shawarma spice, garlic powder, 3 cups water, olive oil, salt, and pepper.
4. Mix until evenly combined.
   - **Note:** For large batches, divide mixture between two trays with 1 cup of water per tray.

### Step 2: Bake

1. Dot the top of the tray with 3 tbsp butter (cut into pieces).
2. Cover tightly with foil.
3. Bake for 40 minutes, until chicken is fully cooked and rice is tender.
   - **Tip:** If using two trays, bake side-by-side on the same rack.

### Step 3: Prep Sides

1. Dice tomatoes into ½-inch pieces, season with salt and pepper.
2. Toss mixed greens with olive oil or preferred dressing. Season lightly with salt and pepper.

### Step 4: Finish & Serve
