### Dairy

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep & Assemble

1. Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450°F (232°C).
2. Wash and dry produce.
3. Remove sausage from casing (if needed) and break into bite-size pieces directly in the oven-ready tray.
4. Make [Tuscan Heat Spice] (if homemade) and measure out 3 tbsp.
5. Add couscous, marinara sauce, Italian cheese blend, Tuscan Heat Spice, and Vidalia onion paste to the tray. Mix well to combine.
6. Top evenly with spinach, pressing it down so no leaves hang over the edges.

### Step 2: Bake Covered

1. Cover the tray tightly with foil.
2. Bake on the middle rack for 30 minutes, until couscous is tender and sausage is almost cooked through.

### Step 3: Uncover & Stir

1. Carefully remove the foil (watch out for steam).
2. Stir the mixture until spinach is fully combined.

### Step 4: Finish Baking

1. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the top.
2. Return to the oven, uncovered, and bake for another 10–12 minutes, until sausage is fully cooked and cheese is melted and golden.

### Step 5: Serve

1. Divide the sausage couscous bake between shallow bowls or plates.
2. Serve hot and enjoy!

## Notes

- Ground pork is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches **160°F**.
- For a zesty kick, squeeze fresh lemon over the finished bowls.
- Swap in chicken sausage for a lighter version.
