## Ingredients

### Produce

- 15 oz Spinach

### Pantry

- 42 oz Marinara Sauce
- 3 tbsp [Tuscan Heat Spice]
- 1.5 oz [Vidalia Onion Spice] (or paste)
- 7.5 oz Israeli Couscous
- Olive Oil
- Salt & Pepper
- 1 large oven-ready baking tray

### Dairy

- 9 tbsp Parmesan Cheese
- 1.5 cups Italian Cheese Blend

### Protein

- 27 oz Italian Pork Sausage

## Instructions

1. **Prep and Assemble:**

   - Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450Â°F (232Â°C).
   - Wash and dry produce.
   - Remove sausage from casing if necessary and break into bite-size pieces in the oven-ready tray.
   - Make the [Tuscan Heat Spice] and measure out 3 tbsp.
   - Add couscous, marinara sauce, Italian cheese blend, stock concentrate (if using), Tuscan Heat Spice, and Vidalia onion paste. Mix well to combine.
   - Top evenly with spinach, pressing it down slightly so no leaves hang over the edges.

2. **Bake Covered:**

   - Cover the tray tightly with foil.
   - Bake on the middle rack for 30 minutes, until couscous is tender and sausage is almost cooked through.

3. **Uncover and Stir:**

   - Carefully remove the foil (watch out for steam!) and stir the mixture until spinach is fully combined.

4. **Finish Baking:**

   - Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the top.
   - Return to the oven, uncovered, and bake for another 10â€“12 minutes, until sausage is fully cooked and cheese is melted and golden.

5. **Serve:**
   - Divide the sausage couscous bake between shallow bowls or plates.
   - Serve hot and enjoy!

> **Ground pork is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160Â°F.**

### ðŸ’¡ Notes

- Want a little extra zing? Add a squeeze of fresh lemon over the finished bowls.
- Substitute chicken sausage if you prefer a lighter version.
