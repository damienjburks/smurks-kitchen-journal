## Ingredients

### Produce

- 3 stalks baby lettuce
- 8 oz sliced dill pickles
- 3 Roma tomatoes

### Pantry

- 1 tbsp fry seasoning
- 5.5 oz beef stock (or 1 concentrate)
- 2 tbsp ketchup
- 6 tsp Dijon mustard
- Cooking oil / olive oil
- Salt
- Pepper

### Dairy

- 6 tbsp mayonnaise
- Â¾ cup Monterey Jack cheese

### Protein

- 30 oz organic ground beef (85% lean, 15% fat)

## Instructions

1. **Prep the Produce:**

   - Wash and dry produce.
   - Trim and discard root end from lettuce; roughly chop.
   - Reserve Â½ tsp pickle brine (1 tsp for 4 servings) in a small bowl; drain remaining brine and roughly chop pickles.
   - Dice tomatoes.
   - Stir Â½ tsp fry seasoning and Â¼ tsp sugar into the reserved pickle brine (1 tsp fry seasoning and Â½ tsp sugar for 4 servings).

2. **Cook the Beef:**

   - Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat.
   - Add beef, remaining fry seasoning, salt, and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned, 3â€“5 minutes.
   - If thereâ€™s excess grease, carefully pour it out.
   - Stir in stock concentrate and Â¼ cup water (â…“ cup for 4 servings). Cook until liquid is absorbed and beef is cooked through, 2â€“3 minutes.
   - Transfer to a plate.

3. **Make the Special Sauce:**

   - To the bowl with pickle brine mixture, add mayonnaise, ketchup, and half the Dijon mustard (all for 4 servings).
   - Stir until well combined.
   - Add water, 1 tsp at a time, until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.

4. **Assemble the Salad:**
   - In a large bowl, toss lettuce with half the dressing and half the tomatoes.
   - Divide salad between bowls. Top with beef, Monterey Jack, pickles, and remaining tomatoes.
   - Drizzle with remaining dressing and serve.

### ðŸ’¡ Notes

- Add an extra spoon of mayo or ketchup for a creamier dressing.
- Swap Monterey Jack for cheddar, Colby Jack, or your favorite melty cheese.
- This salad makes a great meal-prep optionâ€”store the dressing separately and toss when ready to eat.
