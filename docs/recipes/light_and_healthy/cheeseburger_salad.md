## Ingredients

### Produce

- 3 stalks baby lettuce (roughly chopped)
- 8 oz sliced dill pickles (chopped)
- 3 Roma tomatoes (diced)

### Pantry

- 3 tbsp fry seasoning
- 16.5 oz beef stock (or 3 concentrate packets)
- 2 tbsp ketchup
- 2 tsp Dijon mustard
- Cooking oil / olive oil
- Salt & pepper

### Dairy

- 6 tbsp mayonnaise
- ¾ cup Monterey Jack cheese

### Protein

- 30 oz organic ground beef (85% lean, 15% fat)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep the Produce

1. Wash and dry produce.
2. Trim root end from lettuce; roughly chop.
3. Reserve 1½ tsp pickle brine in a small bowl; drain remaining brine and chop pickles.
4. Dice tomatoes.
5. Stir 1½ tsp fry seasoning and ¾ tsp sugar into the reserved pickle brine.

### Step 2: Cook the Beef

1. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat.
2. Add beef, remaining fry seasoning, salt, and pepper.
3. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned, 3–5 minutes.
4. If there’s excess grease, carefully drain it.
5. Stir in stock concentrate and ¾ cup water.
6. Cook until liquid is absorbed and beef is cooked through, 2–3 minutes.
7. Transfer beef to a plate.

### Step 3: Make the Special Sauce

1. To the bowl with pickle brine mixture, add mayonnaise, ketchup, and half the Dijon mustard (use all for 4 servings).
2. Stir until well combined.
3. Add water, 1 tsp at a time, until sauce reaches drizzling consistency.

### Step 4: Assemble the Salad

1. In a large bowl, toss lettuce with half the dressing and half the tomatoes.
2. Divide salad between bowls.
3. Top with beef, Monterey Jack, pickles, and remaining tomatoes.
4. Drizzle with remaining dressing.
5. Serve immediately.

## Notes

- Add extra mayo or ketchup to the sauce for a creamier dressing.
- Swap Monterey Jack for cheddar, Colby Jack, or another melty cheese.
- Great for meal prep—store dressing separately and toss before eating.
