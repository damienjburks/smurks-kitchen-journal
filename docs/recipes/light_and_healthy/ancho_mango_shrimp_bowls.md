## Ingredients

### Produce

- 12 oz mango (fresh or thawed)

### Pantry

- 3 packs microwavable rice (about 8 oz each)
- 9 oz zesty ancho sauce or [red enchilada sauce](https://shop.sprouts.com/store/sprouts/products/17856870-sprouts-organic-red-enchilada-sauce-16-oz)
- Olive oil
- Salt & pepper

### Protein

- 30 oz shrimp (peeled and deveined)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Cook the Shrimp

1. Rinse shrimp under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.
2. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat.
3. Add shrimp and season with salt and pepper.
4. Cook, turning occasionally, until shrimp is opaque and cooked through (3–4 minutes).
5. Transfer to a plate and wipe out the pan.

### Step 2: Cook the Rice & Mango

1. Massage rice packets to break up clumps.
2. Heat another drizzle of olive oil in the same pan over medium-high heat.
3. Add rice, mango (with any juice), and ¼ cup water.
4. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Stir and cook until warmed through and liquid has reduced, 1–2 minutes.

### Step 3: Combine & Finish

1. Remove the pan from heat.
2. Stir in the ancho sauce and half the cooked shrimp.
3. Taste and season with salt and pepper if needed.
4. Divide the rice mixture between bowls.
5. Top with remaining shrimp and serve warm.

## Notes

- Shrimp is fully cooked when it reaches an internal temperature of **145°F**.
- For a spicy twist, stir in a dash of chipotle powder or chili flakes.
- This recipe works great with frozen mango chunks — just thaw before using.
