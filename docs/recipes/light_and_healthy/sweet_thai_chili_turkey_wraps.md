A sprinkle of chopped peanuts adds a satisfying crunch. This is “takeout-style” freshness — ready right from your own kitchen.

- ¾ oz cilantro
- 3 heads baby lettuce
- 12 oz shredded carrots

### Pantry

- 1.5 oz peanuts
- 15 tbsp rice wine vinegar
- 3 oz sweet Thai chili sauce
- 16.5 oz pho stock
- 16.5 oz pork ramen stock concentrate
- 18 ml ponzu sauce
- 3 tsp garlic powder
- 3 tbsp cornstarch
- Olive oil
- Salt & pepper

### Protein

- 30 oz ground turkey (93% lean preferred)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep Produce

1. Wash and dry all produce.
2. Halve, peel, and thinly slice half the onion; finely chop the rest.
3. Quarter cucumbers lengthwise, then slice into quarter-moons.
4. Trim and thinly slice radishes into half-moons.
5. Roughly chop cilantro. Zest and quarter limes.
6. Separate lettuce leaves and roughly chop peanuts.

### Step 2: Quick Pickle the Onion

1. In a medium microwave-safe bowl, combine vinegar, 1 tsp sugar, 1 tbsp water, and a pinch of salt.
2. Add sliced onion and toss to coat. Microwave for 30 seconds, then let sit to marinate.

### Step 3: Make the Salad

1. To the bowl with pickled onion, add cucumber, radishes, carrots, half the cilantro, lime zest, and lime juice.
2. Season with salt and pepper and toss to combine.
3. Set aside to marinate, stirring occasionally.

### Step 4: Make the Sauce

1. In a small bowl, whisk together chili sauce, pho stock, pork ramen concentrate, ponzu, garlic powder, cornstarch, and ¼ cup water until smooth.

### Step 5: Cook the Turkey

1. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat.
2. Add chopped onion and cook until softened (3–4 minutes).
3. Add turkey, season with salt, and cook until browned and mostly cooked through (3–5 minutes).
4. Stir in the sauce mixture. Bring to a simmer and cook until thickened (1–2 minutes).
5. Remove from heat and stir in remaining cilantro and lime zest.

### Step 6: Assemble the Wraps

1. Divide lettuce leaves between plates.
2. Fill with turkey mixture, draining excess liquid if needed.
3. Top with the marinated salad and chopped peanuts.
4. Serve with extra lime wedges and chili sauce on the side.

## Notes

- Turkey is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches **165°F (74°C)**.
- Swap turkey for chicken or pork if desired.
- For extra crunch, top with crispy onions or wonton strips.
