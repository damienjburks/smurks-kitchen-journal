## Overview

Thereâ€™s just something so satisfying about a lettuce wrap: the crisp romaine crunch, the perfectly cradled filling, and that satisfied-but-not-stuffed feeling after dinner. This version features ground turkey seasoned with Turkish-inspired spices, garlic, and soy sauce, then topped with a fresh cucumber, tomato, and red onion salad, finished with feta and a sweet Greek vinaigrette. A refreshing, protein-packed meal youâ€™ll want again and again.

This meal is inspired by [HelloFresh], which we originally used to make this in the past.

## Ingredients

### Produce

- 3 Persian cucumbers
- 3 Roma tomatoes
- 3 red onions
- 6 cloves garlic
- 3 stalks baby lettuce

### Pantry

- 4.5 oz Greek vinaigrette
- 3 tbsp Turkish spice blend
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- Cooking oil / olive oil
- Salt
- Pepper

### Dairy

- 1.5 cups feta cheese

### Protein

- 24 oz ground turkey (93% lean preferred)

## Instructions

1. **Prep the Produce:**

   - Wash and dry produce.
   - Trim and quarter cucumbers lengthwise; slice crosswise into Â½-inch pieces.
   - Dice tomatoes into Â½-inch pieces.
   - Halve, peel, and finely chop onions.
   - Mince or grate garlic.
   - Trim and discard root end from lettuce; separate leaves.

2. **Make the Salad:**

   - In a medium bowl, combine cucumber, tomato, 2 tbsp onion (4 tbsp for 4 servings; reserve the rest), and vinaigrette.
   - Toss to coat and set aside.

3. **Cook the Turkey:**

   - Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat.
   - Add remaining onion and a pinch of salt; cook until slightly softened, 2â€“3 minutes.
   - Add turkey, Turkish spice, garlic, and half the soy sauce (all for 4 servings).
   - Cook, breaking meat into pieces, until turkey is cooked through, 4â€“6 minutes.
   - Season with salt and pepper to taste.
   - Tip: Stir in a splash of water near the end of cooking to keep turkey saucy.

4. **Assemble the Wraps:**
   - Divide lettuce leaves between plates.
   - Fill each with turkey mixture and cucumber-tomato salad.
   - Spoon any remaining vinaigrette over top.
   - Garnish with feta and serve immediately.

### ðŸ’¡ Notes

- For a tangier flavor, add a squeeze of lemon juice to the salad before serving.
- Swap turkey for chicken or beef if you prefer.
- Great for meal prepâ€”store filling and salad separately, then assemble when ready to eat.
