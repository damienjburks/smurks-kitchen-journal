## Overview

There’s just something so satisfying about a lettuce wrap: the crisp romaine crunch, the perfectly cradled filling, and that satisfied-but-not-stuffed feeling after dinner. This version features ground turkey seasoned with Turkish-inspired spices, garlic, and soy sauce, then topped with a fresh cucumber, tomato, and red onion salad, finished with feta and a sweet Greek vinaigrette. A refreshing, protein-packed meal you’ll want again and again.

This meal is inspired by [HelloFresh], which we originally used to make this in the past.
