## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep & Roast Vegetables

1. Preheat oven to 425°F and adjust rack to top position.
2. Wash and dry produce.
3. Trim and halve Brussels sprouts.

8. Roast until golden brown and tender, 20–22 minutes.

### Step 2: Cook the Chicken

1. Pat chicken dry with paper towels.
2. Season all over with fry seasoning, ¼ tsp thyme, salt, and pepper (use more thyme for larger servings).
3. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat.
4. Add chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, 5–7 minutes per side.
