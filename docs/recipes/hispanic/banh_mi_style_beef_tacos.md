## Overview

Combining tender meat, crunchy pickled veggies, fresh cilantro, spicy chiles, and creamy spreads, the Vietnamese banh mi is one of our all-time favorite sandwiches. Here, we take all those same flavors and textures and channel them into some seriously delicious tacos. Tangy-sweet beef is piled into warm tortillas with sautÃ©ed carrots, pickled cucumber, cilantro, and Sriracha mayo. Taco â€™bout an epic dinner!

This meal is inspired by [HelloFresh], which we originally used to make this in the past.

## Instructions

1. **Prep the Produce:**

   - Wash and dry produce.

   - Trim and halve cucumbers lengthwise; thinly slice into half-moons.
   - Finely chop cilantro.

2. **Quick-Pickle the Cucumbers:**

   - In a small bowl, combine half the vinegar (reserve the rest), juice from half the lime, Â½ tsp sugar (1 tsp for 4 servings), and a pinch of salt.
   - Stir in cucumber. Set aside to quick-pickle.

3. **Cook the Carrots:**

   - Heat a drizzle of oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium-high heat.
   - Add carrots and cook, stirring, until just tender, 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper.
   - Turn off heat; transfer to a plate.

4. **Cook the Beef:**

   - Heat another drizzle of oil in the same pan over medium-high heat.
   - Add beef; season with a pinch of salt and pepper.
   - Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4â€“6 minutes.
   - Stir in sweet soy glaze and remaining vinegar.
   - Bring to a simmer, then immediately turn off heat.
   - Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

5. **Make the Sriracha Mayo:**

   - In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise with Sriracha to taste.
   - Season with salt.
   - Stir in water, 1 tsp at a time, until mixture reaches drizzling consistency.

6. **Warm the Tortillas & Assemble:**
   - Wrap tortillas in damp paper towels and microwave until warm and pliable, ~30 seconds.
   - Divide tortillas between plates and fill with saucy beef, carrots, pickled cucumber (draining first), and cilantro.
   - Drizzle with Sriracha mayo.
   - Cut remaining lime into wedges and serve on the side.

### ðŸ’¡ Notes

- **Ground beef is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160Â°F.**
- Want extra crispy tortillas? Lightly brush tortillas with olive oil before broiling.
- Adjust spice by adding more or less Sriracha to the mayo.
