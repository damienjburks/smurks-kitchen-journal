## Overview

Combining tender meat, crunchy pickled veggies, fresh cilantro, spicy chiles, and creamy spreads, the Vietnamese banh mi is one of our all-time favorite sandwiches. Here, we take all those same flavors and textures and channel them into some seriously delicious tacos. Tangy-sweet beef is piled into warm tortillas with sautéed carrots, pickled cucumber, cilantro, and Sriracha mayo. Taco ’bout an epic dinner!

This meal is inspired by [HelloFresh], which we originally used to make this in the past.
