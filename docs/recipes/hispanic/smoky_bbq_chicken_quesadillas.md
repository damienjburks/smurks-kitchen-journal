## Overview

These Smoky BBQ Chicken Quesadillas are the definition of comfort food made simple. Tender chicken breast is seasoned and cooked with smoky spices, then folded into golden flour tortillas with shallots, tangy BBQ sauce, and gooey mozzarella. Each quesadilla is crisped in butter and oil until perfectly golden, then finished with a drizzle of smoky red pepper crema and a sprinkle of fresh cilantro. Fast, cheesy, and crowd-pleasing, this is weeknight cooking at its best.

This recipe is inspired by [HelloFresh], which we originally used to make this at home.
