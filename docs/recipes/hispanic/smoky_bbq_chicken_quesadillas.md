2. **Cook chicken**  
   Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken; season with fry seasoning, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through, 4â€“6 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Wipe out pan.

   Cut quesadillas into wedges. Drizzle with smoky red pepper crema, garnish with remaining cilantro, and serve warm.

- Adjust sweetness by using a tangier BBQ sauce if preferred.
