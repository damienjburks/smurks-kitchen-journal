## Ingredients

### Produce

- 3 Shallots
- 6 Scallions
- 3 Thumbs of Fresh Ginger
- 3 Cloves Garlic
- 6 Mini Cucumbers
- 9 oz Carrots

### Pantry

- 3 tbsp Sesame Oil
- 6 tbsp Soy Sauce
- 12 tbsp Mayonnaise
- 3 tsp Sriracha
- 3 tbsp Sesame Seeds
- 15 tsp White Wine Vinegar

### Dairy

- 9 tbsp Sour Cream
- 1.5 cups Mexican Cheese Blend

### Protein

- 30 oz Organic Ground Pork

### Bread

- 18 Medium Flour Tortillas

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep

• Wash and dry all produce.  
• Thinly slice cucumbers into rounds.  
• Halve, peel, and thinly slice shallots.  
• Grate carrots using the large holes of a box grater.  
• Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.  
• Peel and finely grate or mince garlic and ginger.

### Step 2: Make Pickled Salad & Sriracha Mayo

• In a medium bowl, whisk together white wine vinegar, half the sesame oil, 1 tsp soy sauce, and 1 tsp sugar.  
• Add cucumbers, shallots, and grated carrots. Toss and let sit to pickle, stirring occasionally.  
• In a small bowl, mix mayonnaise with as much Sriracha as desired. Set aside.

### Step 3: Make Pork Meatballs

• In a separate bowl, mix ground pork, scallion whites, ginger, garlic, remaining sesame oil, 2 tsp soy sauce, salt, and pepper.  
• Form into 18 2-inch meatballs (3 per serving).

### Step 4: Assemble Gyoza Tacos

• Place each meatball in the center of a tortilla on a clean surface.  
• Cover with plastic wrap and press down to flatten the pork to the edges of the tortilla.  
**TIP:** You can reuse the same piece of plastic wrap to save time.

### Step 5: Cook Tacos

• Heat a drizzle of oil in a large nonstick pan over medium heat.  
• Working in batches, cook meat-side down for 2–3 minutes until browned.  
• Flip and cook the tortilla side for 30–60 seconds more until lightly toasted.  
• Transfer to a paper towel-lined tray and cover with foil to keep warm.  
**TIP:** Lower heat as needed for later batches.

### Step 6: Finish & Serve

• Drain pickled veggies and toss with half the scallion greens. Season to taste.  
• Divide tacos among plates. Top each with pickled veggie mix, a drizzle of Sriracha mayo, remaining scallion greens, and sesame seeds. Serve immediately.

> **Note:** Ground pork is fully cooked when it reaches an internal temperature of 160°F.
