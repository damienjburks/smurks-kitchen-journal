## Overview

✨ Hearty, tangy, and deeply comforting — this classic Dominican chicken stew is pure homestyle flavor in every bite.

Pollo guisado, a beloved Dominican dish, combines tender chicken simmered with tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, and green olives. The secret? A quick marination with lime, oregano, and a touch of sugar that builds rich, layered flavor. Served over zesty lime rice, it’s a balanced, vibrant, and soul-warming meal that’s simple enough for weeknights yet special enough for Sunday dinner.

Inspired by [HelloFresh], this version stays true to the Caribbean roots — bright, savory, and full of warmth.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Cook the Rice

1. In a small pot, combine rice, 1¼ cups water, and a pinch of salt (adjust for serving size).
2. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to low.
3. Simmer until rice is tender (15–18 minutes).
4. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.

### Step 2: Prep the Ingredients

1. Wash and dry produce.
2. Zest and quarter limes.
3. Peel and mince garlic.
4. Halve, core, and slice bell peppers into thin strips.
5. Halve, peel, and slice onions into thin wedges.
6. Roughly chop olives and dice tomatoes.

### Step 3: Marinate the Chicken

1. In a bowl, combine chicken with oregano, half the Southwest Spice Blend, ¼ tsp sugar, olive oil, juice from half a lime, salt, and pepper.
2. Mix to coat and let marinate for at least 5 minutes.

### Step 4: Sear the Chicken

1. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium heat.
2. Add chicken and marinade; cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned (2–3 minutes).
3. The chicken will finish cooking in the stew.
