## Overview

When it comes to Mexican-style cuisine, burritos usually steal the spotlight — but enchiladas deserve just as much love. They're technically easier-to-assemble burritos that get smothered in a delicious sauce, but really, they're so much more than that! Our version starts with spiced beef and charred green peppers, rolled up in warm tortillas, topped with tangy salsa verde and melty cheese, then baked until golden and bubbly. Hear that? That’s the sound of the dinner bell!

This meal is inspired by [HelloFresh], which we originally used to make this in the past.

## Ingredients

### Produce

- 3 Long Green Peppers

### Pantry

- 21 oz Salsa Verde
- 3 tbsp Southwest Spice Blend
- 3 tsp Hot Sauce
- Olive Oil
- Salt & Pepper

### Dairy

- 9 tbsp Sour Cream
- 1.5 cups Mexican Cheese Blend

### Protein

- 30 oz Organic Ground Beef (85% lean, 15% fat)

### Bread

- 18 Medium Flour Tortillas

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep the Vegetables

1. Adjust oven rack to top position and heat broiler to high.
2. Wash and dry produce.
3. Halve, core, and thinly slice the green peppers crosswise into strips.

### Step 2: Make the Crema

1. In a small bowl, combine sour cream and hot sauce to taste.
2. Stir in water, 1 tsp at a time, until the crema reaches a drizzling consistency.
3. Season with salt and pepper.

### Step 3: Cook the Peppers

1. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large ovenproof pan over medium-high heat.
2. Add green peppers, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly charred (5–7 minutes).

### Step 4: Cook the Beef

1. Add another drizzle of oil to the pan with peppers.
2. Add beef and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned and cooked through.
3. Season with Southwest spice blend, salt, and pepper.
4. Stir in 1/4 of the salsa verde (reserve the rest).
5. Taste and adjust seasoning.
6. Turn off heat and transfer beef mixture to a medium bowl. Wipe out pan.

### Step 5: Assemble the Enchiladas

1. Place a small amount of beef filling on one half of each tortilla.
2. Roll tortillas up from the filled side to form enchiladas.
3. Arrange enchiladas seam-side down in the same pan (or in a 9x13" baking dish if needed).
4. Top with remaining salsa verde and sprinkle with Mexican cheese blend.

### Step 6: Broil

1. Place enchiladas under the broiler on the top rack.
2. Broil 3–4 minutes until cheese is browned and bubbly.
3. Watch carefully to prevent burning.

### Step 7: Finish & Serve

1. Drizzle enchiladas with crema.
2. Serve hot and enjoy!

## Notes

- **Ground beef is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160°F.**
- For extra-crispy tortillas, lightly brush with olive oil before broiling.
- Adjust spice level by using more or less hot sauce in the crema.
