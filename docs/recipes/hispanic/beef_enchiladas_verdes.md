## Overview

When it comes to Mexican-style cuisine, burritos usually steal the spotlight â€” but enchiladas deserve just as much love. They're technically easier-to-assemble burritos that get smothered in a delicious sauce, but really, they're so much more than that! Our version starts with spiced beef and charred green peppers, rolled up in warm tortillas, topped with tangy salsa verde and melty cheese, then baked until golden and bubbly. Hear that? Thatâ€™s the sound of the dinner bell!

This meal is inspired by [Hello Fresh], which we originally used to make this in the past.

## Ingredients

### Produce

- 3 Long Green Peppers
- 6 Scallions

### Pantry

- 21 oz Salsa Verde
- 3 tbsp Southwest Spice Blend
- 3 tsp Hot Sauce
- Olive Oil
- Salt & Pepper

### Dairy

- 9 tbsp Sour Cream
- 1.5 cups Mexican Cheese Blend

### Protein

- 30 oz Organic Beef (85% lean, 15% fat)

### Bread

- 6 medium Flour Tortillas

## Instructions

1. **Prep the Vegetables:**  
   - Adjust rack to top position and heat broiler to high.
   - Wash and dry produce.
   - Halve, core, and thinly slice the green peppers crosswise into strips.
   - Thinly slice the scallions, separating whites and greens.

2. **Make the Crema:**  
   - In a small bowl, combine sour cream and hot sauce to taste.
   - Stir in water 1 teaspoon at a time until it reaches a drizzling consistency.
   - Season with salt and pepper.

3. **Cook the Peppers:**  
   - Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large, preferably ovenproof, pan over medium-high heat.
   - Add green peppers; season with salt and pepper.
   - Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly charred, 5â€“7 minutes.

4. **Cook the Beef:**  
   - Add another drizzle of oil to the same pan.
   - Add beef and cook, breaking it up with a spoon.
   - Season with Southwest Spice Blend, salt, and pepper.
   - Cook until browned and cooked through, 4â€“6 minutes.
   - Stir in 3/4 of the salsa verde (youâ€™ll use the rest later); taste and adjust seasoning as needed.
   - Turn off heat and transfer beef mixture to a medium bowl. Wipe out pan.

5. **Assemble the Enchiladas:**  
   - Place a small amount of beef filling on one half of each tortilla.
   - Roll up the tortillas, starting with the filled sides, to form enchiladas.
   - Arrange enchiladas seam-side down in the pan used for cooking the beef (or in a 9x13" baking dish if needed).
   - Top with the remaining salsa verde and sprinkle evenly with the Mexican cheese blend.

6. **Broil:**  
   - Broil enchiladas on the top rack until browned and bubbly, 3â€“4 minutes.
   - Watch carefully to avoid burning.

7. **Finish and Serve:**  
   - Drizzle enchiladas with crema.
   - Garnish with scallion greens.
   - Serve hot and enjoy!

### ðŸ’¡ Notes

- **Ground beef is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160Â°F.**
- Want extra crispy tortillas? Lightly brush tortillas with olive oil before broiling.
- Customize your spice level by adding more or less hot sauce to the crema.
