## Ingredients

### Produce

- 24 oz broccoli  
- 18 oz asparagus  
- 1 big stalk scallions

### Pantry

- 2.25 cups jasmine rice  
- 3 tsp Korean chili flakes  
- 12 tbsp sweet soy glaze  
- 3 tsp honey  
- 3 tbsp sesame seeds  
- 6 tbsp mayonnaise  
- 3 tsp sriracha  
- 6 tsp garlic powder  
- Olive oil  
- Salt & pepper

### Protein

- 30 oz salmon

## Instructions

### Step 1: Cook Rice

- In a small pot, combine jasmine rice, 1¼ cups water (2¼ cups for 4 servings), and a pinch of salt.  
- Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low.  
- Cook until tender, 15–20 minutes.  
- Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.

### Step 2: Prep Produce & Salmon

- While rice cooks, wash and dry produce.  
- Cut broccoli into bite-size pieces if necessary.  
- Trim and thinly slice scallions.  
- Pat salmon dry with paper towels.  
- Using a sharp knife, slowly cut between flesh and skin until skin is removed; discard skin.

### Step 3: Season & Toss

- In a medium bowl, toss broccoli with a large drizzle of olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.  
- In a second medium bowl, toss salmon chunks with half the sweet soy glaze until evenly coated.

### Step 4: Air Fry

- Coat an air fryer basket with nonstick spray.  
- Arrange salmon and broccoli in basket in separate sections.  
  **TIP:** Work in batches if necessary.  
- Air-fry at 390°F until salmon starts to turn opaque, 4–6 minutes.  
- Remove basket; carefully brush salmon with remaining sweet soy glaze.  
- Return to air fryer; cook until glaze is tacky and salmon is cooked through, 1–2 minutes more.  
- Transfer salmon to a small bowl; continue to air-fry broccoli until tender, 2–3 minutes.

### Step 5: Make Spicy Mayo

- In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, sriracha, half the honey, and chili flakes to taste.  
- Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.  
- Season with salt and pepper.

### Step 6: Serve

- Fluff rice with a fork.  
- Divide rice, salmon, and broccoli between shallow bowls in separate sections.  
- Drizzle with spicy mayo; top with scallions, sesame seeds, and remaining chili flakes.  
- Serve immediately.
