## Overview

Both savory and sweet, this flavor‑packed rice bowl is a weeknight dinner winner. Crispy‑skinned salmon is drizzled with a ponzu‑hoisin sauce and served with fluffy rice and buttery cabbage and carrots sautéed with that same salty‑sweet sauce. Finished with a sprinkle of fresh scallion greens and chili flakes for heat, dinner doesn’t get more crave‑worthy than this!

Inspired by our original [HelloFresh] meal kit experience, this one remains a favorite in our dinner rotation.

## Ingredients

### Produce

- 6 cloves garlic  
- 1 big stalk scallions  
- 12 oz red cabbage and carrot mix

### Pantry

- 54 ml ponzu sauce  
- 3 tsp Korean chili flakes  
- 6 tbsp hoisin sauce  
- 2.25 cups white rice  
- Vegetable oil  
- Salt & pepper

### Protein

- 30 oz salmon

### Dairy

- 1 tbsp butter  

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep

- Wash and dry all produce.  
- Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.  
- Peel and mince or grate garlic.  
- In a small bowl, combine hoisin, ponzu, and 3 tbsp water (6 tbsp for 4 servings).

### Step 2: Cook Rice

- In a small pot, combine rice, 1¼ cups water (2¼ cups for 4 servings), and a pinch of salt.  
- Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer.  
- Cook until rice is tender, 15–18 minutes.  
- Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.

### Step 3: Sear Salmon

- While rice cooks, pat salmon dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper.  
- Heat a drizzle of oil in a medium (or large for 4 servings), preferably nonstick, pan over medium‑high heat.  
- Add salmon, skin sides down, to the pan.  
- Cook until skin is crisp, 5–7 minutes.  
- Flip and cook until cooked through, 1–2 minutes more.  
- Turn off heat; transfer to a plate to rest and wipe out pan.

### Step 4: Sauté Veggies

- Melt butter in the pan used for salmon over medium heat.  
- Stir in cabbage and carrot mix and scallion whites.  
- Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, 1–2 minutes.  
- Add garlic and as many chili flakes as you like (we used ½ tsp; 1 tsp for 4).  
- Cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute more.  
- Season with salt and pepper to taste.

### Step 5: Add Sauce

- Push veggies to one side of pan; transfer salmon to the empty side.  
- Spoon ponzu mixture over salmon.  
- Cook until sauce has slightly thickened, 30–60 seconds.  
- Turn off heat and transfer salmon back to plate.  
- Stir veggies in sauce until coated.

### Step 6: Serve

- Divide rice between shallow bowls.  
- Top with saucy cabbage and carrots and salmon.  
- Sprinkle bowls with scallion greens (and any remaining chili flakes if you like things spicy!).  
- Serve hot.
