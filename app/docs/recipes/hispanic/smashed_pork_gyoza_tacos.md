- 3 Cloves Garlic (minced)
- 6 Mini Cucumbers (sliced into rounds)
- 9 oz Carrots (grated)

### Pantry

- 3 tbsp Sesame Oil
- 6 tbsp Soy Sauce
- 12 tbsp Mayonnaise
- 3 tsp Sriracha
- 3 tbsp Sesame Seeds
- 10 tsp White Wine Vinegar
- Salt & Pepper

### Dairy

- 9 tbsp Sour Cream

### Protein

- 30 oz Organic Ground Pork

### Bread

- 18 Medium Flour Tortillas

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep

1. Wash and dry all produce.
2. Thinly slice cucumbers into rounds.
3. Halve, peel, and thinly slice shallots.
4. Grate carrots using the large holes of a box grater.
5. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.
6. Peel and finely grate or mince garlic and ginger.

### Step 2: Make Pickled Salad & Sriracha Mayo

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together:
   - White wine vinegar
   - Half the sesame oil
   - 1 tsp soy sauce
   - 1 tsp sugar
2. Add cucumbers, shallots, and grated carrots. Toss and let sit to pickle, stirring occasionally.
3. In a small bowl, mix mayonnaise with desired amount of Sriracha. Set aside.

### Step 3: Make Pork Meatballs

1. In a large bowl, combine:
   - Ground pork
   - Scallion whites
   - Ginger
   - Garlic
   - Remaining sesame oil
   - 2 tsp soy sauce
   - Pinch of salt and pepper
2. Mix until just combined.
3. Form into 18 meatballs (about 2 inches each, 3 per serving).

### Step 4: Assemble Gyoza Tacos

1. Place each meatball in the center of a tortilla on a clean surface.
2. Cover with plastic wrap and press down to flatten pork to the edges of the tortilla.
   - **Tip:** Reuse the same piece of plastic wrap for efficiency.

### Step 5: Cook Tacos

1. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large nonstick pan over medium heat.
2. Working in batches, place tacos meat-side down.
   - Cook 2–3 minutes until browned.
   - Flip and cook tortilla side 30–60 seconds until toasted.
3. Transfer to a paper towel–lined tray and cover with foil to keep warm.
   - **Tip:** Lower heat as needed for later batches.

### Step 6: Finish & Serve

1. Drain pickled veggies and toss with half the scallion greens. Season to taste.
2. Divide tacos among plates.
3. Top with:
   - Pickled veggie mix
   - Drizzle of Sriracha mayo
   - Remaining scallion greens
   - Sesame seeds
4. Serve immediately.

## Notes

- **Ground pork is fully cooked when it reaches an internal temperature of 160°F.**
- For extra crunch, toast tortillas in a dry pan before assembling.
- Adjust spice by increasing or reducing the Sriracha.
