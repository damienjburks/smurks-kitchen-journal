## Overview

This week, we’re serving a hearty, flavorful black bean soup that’s ready in just 20 minutes—and it all cooks up in one pot, making cleanup a breeze! The beans are simmered in a richly spiced broth with diced tomatoes, veggie stock, onion, tomato paste, and Southwest seasonings until the soup is thick and the beans are tender. For toppings, load up your bowl with “the works”—scallions, cheddar cheese, smoky red pepper crema, and crushed blue corn tortilla chips. Now that’s what we call a truly SOUP‑er supper.

This meal is inspired by [HelloFresh], which we originally used to make this in the past.

## Ingredients

### Produce

- 3 yellow onions  
- 1 big stalk scallions  
- 3 Roma tomatoes  
- ~40 oz black beans

### Pantry

- 3 tbsp Southwest spice blend  
- 4.5 oz tomato paste  
- Tex‑Mex paste  
- 4.5 oz blue corn tortilla chips  
- 16.5 oz veggie stock concentrate  
- Olive oil  
- Salt & pepper

### Dairy

- 1.5 cups cheddar cheese

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep Produce

- Wash and dry all produce.  
- Halve, peel, and very finely dice the onion until you have ~¾ cup (1½ cups for 4 servings).  
- Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.  
- Dice tomatoes.  
- Drain beans over a small bowl, reserving the liquid.

### Step 2: Cook Aromatics

- Heat a large drizzle of olive oil in a large pot over medium‑high heat.  
- Add diced onion and scallion whites; cook, stirring, until softened, 3–4 minutes.  
- Add Southwest spice; stir until fragrant, 30 seconds.  
- Stir in diced tomato, tomato paste, and Tex‑Mex paste until slightly darkened in color, 1 minute.

### Step 3: Simmer Soup

- Stir 1¾ cups water, veggie stock concentrates, beans, and ¼ cup reserved bean liquid into pot. (For 4 servings, use 3 cups water and ½ cup bean liquid.)  
- Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 5–8 minutes.  
  **TIP:** Prefer your broth thicker? Simmer a little longer—or vice versa!  
- Taste and season with salt and pepper. Turn off heat.

### Step 4: Serve

- Divide soup between bowls.  
- Top with scallion greens, cheddar cheese, smoky red pepper crema (optional), and as many crushed tortilla chips as you like.  
  **TIP:** Start with a few crushed chips and add more as you go to keep them crunchy!  
- Serve immediately.
