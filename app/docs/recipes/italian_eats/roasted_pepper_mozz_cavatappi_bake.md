## Ingredients

### Produce

- 3 Bell Peppers
- 3/4 oz Chives

### Pantry

- 36 oz Marinara Sauce
- 3/4 cup Panko Breadcrumbs
- 18 oz Cavatappi Pasta
- 3 tsp Chili Flakes (to taste)
- Olive Oil
- Salt & Pepper

### Dairy

- 12 oz Fresh Mozzarella
- 6 tbsp Cream Cheese

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep & Boil

- Adjust oven rack to the top position and preheat to 400°F.
- Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
- Wash and dry all produce.
- Halve bell peppers lengthwise; remove stems and seeds.
- Thinly slice chives.
- Tear mozzarella into bite-size pieces.

### Step 2: Roast the Bell Peppers

- Rub bell pepper halves with olive oil, season with salt and pepper.
- Place cut-side down on a baking sheet.
- Roast on the top rack until softened and slightly charred, 20–25 minutes.

### Step 3: Mix the Panko Topping

- In a small microwave-safe bowl, melt 1 tbsp butter (or 2 tbsp for 4 servings).
- Stir in panko and a pinch of salt. Set aside.

### Step 4: Cook the Pasta

- Once the water is boiling, add cavatappi and cook until al dente, 9–11 minutes.
- Drain and set aside.

### Step 5: Simmer the Sauce

- While pasta cooks, heat a large (preferably ovenproof) pan over medium-high heat.
- Add marinara sauce, 1/2 cup water (or 3/4 cup for 4 servings), half the chives, a pinch of chili flakes, and a big pinch of salt.
- Bring to a boil, then reduce to medium and simmer until thickened, 3–5 minutes.
- Turn off heat and stir in cream cheese until smooth.
- Season with salt and pepper to taste.

### Step 6: Combine & Bake

- When peppers are done, let cool slightly and thinly slice.
- Set oven to broil.
- Stir sliced peppers and drained pasta into the sauce. If sauce is too thick, add a splash of water.
- If your pan isn't ovenproof, transfer mixture to a baking dish.
- Top with mozzarella and panko mixture.
- Broil until cheese is melted and panko is golden, 2–4 minutes. Watch carefully!

### Step 7: Finish & Serve

- Sprinkle with remaining chives and more chili flakes (if desired).
- Serve family-style or divide onto plates.

## Notes

- To make it heartier, add cooked Italian sausage or roasted chicken before baking.
- For extra creaminess, stir in a splash of heavy cream with the marinara.
- Leftovers can be refrigerated for up to 3 days and reheat well in the oven or microwave.
