## Overview

Have you ever had penne alla vodka and loved the sauce so much you wanted to drink it up with a straw? No? Just us? Well, that’s kind of what this creamy tomato soup is like. It’s got the added bonus of Italian sausage, bright pops of peas, and Italian seasoning to make it extra zesty. There’s also a cheesy, crusty baguette to round out the meal. All this in 20 minutes? It’s not just supper, it’s *souper*!

## Ingredients

### Produce

- 12 oz peas

### Pantry

- 3 tbsp Italian seasoning  
- 6 tbsp cornstarch  
- 16.5 oz chicken stock concentrate  
- 16.5 oz mushroom stock concentrate  
- 4.5 oz tomato paste  
- 3 demi baguettes  
- Salt & pepper

### Dairy

- 1.5 cups Italian cheese blend  
- 1 tbsp butter

### Protein

- 54 oz Italian pork sausage mix

## Instructions

### Step 1: Brown Sausage

- Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 450°F.  
- Remove sausage from casing if necessary.  
- Melt butter in a medium pot over medium‑high heat.  
- Add sausage and half the Italian seasoning.  
- Cook, breaking up meat, until browned and cooked through, 4–6 minutes.

### Step 2: Build Soup Base

- While sausage cooks, whisk cornstarch with ½ cup cold water in a medium bowl; set aside.  
- Stir tomato paste into the pot and cook until combined, about 30 seconds.  
- Increase heat to high and stir in:
  - Chicken stock concentrate  
  - Mushroom stock concentrate  
  - Cornstarch slurry  
  - 1½ cups hot water (3½ cups for 4 servings)  
- Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 5 minutes.  
  **TIP:** If soup is too thick, stir in an extra ¼ cup water.

- Remove from heat and stir in peas.  
- Season generously with salt and pepper.

### Step 3: Make Cheesy Bread

- Halve baguettes lengthwise and place cut‑side up on a baking sheet.  
- Sprinkle with half the Italian cheese blend.  
- Bake on top rack until cheese melts, 4–6 minutes.

### Step 4: Serve

- Divide soup between bowls and top with remaining cheese.  
- Serve with cheesy baguette on the side.
