## Ingredients

### Produce

- 3 shallots  
- 3 cloves garlic  
- 3 zucchinis

### Pantry

- 3 tbsp Italian seasoning  
- 4.5 oz tomato paste  
- 16.5 oz beef stock concentrate  
- 18 oz rigatoni pasta  
- Olive oil  
- Butter  
- Sugar  
- Salt & pepper

### Dairy

- 12 tbsp cream cheese  
- 9 tbsp Parmesan cheese

### Protein

- 30 oz ground beef

## Instructions

### Step 1: Cook Pasta

- Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  
- Once boiling, add rigatoni and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9–11 minutes.  
- Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water (1½ cups for 4 servings), then drain.

### Step 2: Prep Produce

- Meanwhile, wash and dry produce.  
- Halve, peel, and finely dice shallot.  
- Peel and mince or grate garlic.  
- Trim and grate zucchini on the largest holes of a box grater.  
- Place grated zucchini in the center of a clean kitchen towel and squeeze over the sink to remove as much liquid as possible.  
  **TIP:** Alternatively, place grated zucchini in a fine‑mesh strainer and press down with a spatula.

### Step 3: Brown Beef

- Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium‑high heat.  
- Add beef, shallot, Italian seasoning, a big pinch of salt, and pepper.  
- Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and mostly cooked through, 3–5 minutes (it’ll finish cooking in the next step).

### Step 4: Build Sauce

- Add tomato paste to the pan with beef.  
- Cook, stirring, until tomato paste is well combined and beef is cooked through, 1–2 minutes.  
- Stir in zucchini, garlic, and a big pinch of salt.  
- Cook, stirring, until zucchini is tender, 2–3 minutes.  
- Stir in cream cheese, beef stock concentrate, ½ cup reserved pasta cooking water, and ½ tsp sugar (for 4 servings, use 2/3 cup pasta water and 1 tsp sugar).  
- Simmer until sauce has slightly thickened, 1–2 minutes.  
- Season with salt and pepper.  
  **TIP:** Add a pinch of chili flakes for a spicy kick.

### Step 5: Finish Pasta

- Reduce heat to medium‑low.  
- Stir drained rigatoni, half the Parmesan, and 1 tbsp butter (2 tbsp for 4 servings) into the pan with sauce until combined.  
- If needed, stir in more reserved cooking water a splash at a time until pasta is coated in a creamy sauce.

### Step 6: Serve

- Divide pasta between plates or bowls.  
- Top with remaining Parmesan and serve hot.
