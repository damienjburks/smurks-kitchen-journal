## Ingredients

### Produce

- 3 cloves garlic  
- 3 zucchinis

### Pantry

- 18 oz spaghetti  
- 3 tbsp Tuscan heat spice  
- 36 oz marinara sauce  
- Olive oil  
- Salt & pepper

### Dairy

- 9 tbsp Parmesan cheese  
- 1 tbsp butter

### Protein

- 27 oz Italian chicken sausage

## Instructions

### Step 1: Boil Pasta

- Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  
- Once boiling, add spaghetti and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9–11 minutes.  
- Reserve ½ cup pasta cooking water (1 cup for 4 servings), then drain.

### Step 2: Prep Produce

- While pasta cooks, wash and dry produce.  
- Peel and mince garlic.  
- Trim ends from zucchini. Using a peeler, shave zucchini lengthwise into thin ribbons, rotating as you go, until you reach the seedy core; discard core.

### Step 3: Cook Sausage

- Remove sausage from casing if necessary; discard casing.  
- Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium‑high heat.  
- Add sausage and cook, breaking up meat, until browned and cooked through, 4–6 minutes.  
- Stir in garlic and Tuscan heat spice; cook until fragrant, 30 seconds.

### Step 4: Add Sauce

- Add marinara to the pan with the sausage mixture, then reduce heat to medium.  
- Simmer until flavors meld and sauce has slightly reduced, 3–4 minutes.

### Step 5: Combine Pasta

- Add drained spaghetti, ¼ cup reserved pasta cooking water (½ cup for 4 servings), and butter to the pan with sauce.  
- Toss to thoroughly combine.  
- Separate zucchini ribbons with your hands, then stir into pasta until slightly softened, 1–2 minutes.  
- Taste and season with salt and pepper.  
  **TIP:** If needed, stir in more reserved cooking water a splash at a time until spaghetti is thoroughly coated in sauce.

### Step 6: Serve

- Divide pasta between bowls; top with Parmesan and serve hot.
