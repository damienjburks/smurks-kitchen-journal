## Ingredients

### Produce

- 3 cloves garlic  
- 1 big stalk scallions  
- 3 bell peppers

### Pantry

- 16.5 oz veggie stock concentrate  
- 27 oz butternut squash agnolotti  
- Salt & pepper

### Dairy

- 4.5 tbsp sour cream  
- 6 tbsp cream cheese  
- 9 tbsp Parmesan cheese  
- 1 tbsp butter

## Instructions

### Step 1: Roast Veggies

- Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 400°F.  
- Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil.  
- Wash and dry produce.  
- Halve bell peppers; remove stem and seeds.  
- Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.

- Drizzle bell pepper halves with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  
- Arrange cut sides down on a lightly oiled baking sheet.  
- Peel garlic; place cloves in the center of a small piece of foil.  
- Drizzle with oil and season with salt and pepper; cinch into a packet and place on the same sheet.  
- Roast on top rack until bell peppers are lightly charred and garlic is softened, 20–25 minutes.

### Step 2: Cook Agnolotti

- Once bell pepper and garlic have roasted ~15 minutes, add agnolotti to the pot of boiling water.  
- Reduce to a low simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente and floating to the top, 3–5 minutes.  
- Reserve ½ cup pasta cooking water (1 cup for 4 servings), then drain and set aside.  
- Keep empty pot handy for Step 5.

### Step 3: Prep Roasted Veggies

- When bell pepper and garlic are done, carefully transfer to a cutting board.  
- Thinly slice bell peppers and gently mash garlic with a fork until smooth.

### Step 4: Make Sauce

- Heat a drizzle of olive oil in the pot used for pasta over medium‑high heat.  
- Add scallion whites and cook, stirring, until fragrant, ~1 minute.  
- Add ¼ cup reserved pasta cooking water (⅓ cup for 4 servings), stock concentrate, cream cheese, sour cream, half the Parmesan, and butter; stir until smooth.  
- Stir in roasted bell pepper and mashed garlic.  
- Bring to a simmer and cook until slightly thickened, 1–2 minutes.  
- Turn off heat. Season with salt and pepper.

### Step 5: Combine Pasta & Serve

- Stir agnolotti into sauce in the pot.  
  **TIP:** If needed, stir in more reserved pasta cooking water, a splash at a time, until pasta is coated in a creamy sauce.  
- Divide between bowls.  
- Season with pepper. Garnish with scallion greens and remaining Parmesan.  
- Serve hot.
