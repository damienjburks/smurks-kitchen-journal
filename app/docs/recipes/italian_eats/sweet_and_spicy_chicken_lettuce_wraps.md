## Overview

One day, Sweet and Spicy Chicken was feeling extra‑saucy (a dose of hoisin‑style bulgogi and gochujang will do that) and went shopping. “Ooh, check me out!,” it said, “this lettuce wrap is so cool and fresh!” And like any outfit, no wrap is complete without accessories. Crown this whole 15‑minute ensemble with crunchy, citrusy sesame cabbage slaw, a sprinkle of scallion greens, and a shower of crackly, nutty sesame seeds. After all, good taste (and a lightning‑quick dinner) is always in style!

This meal is inspired by [HelloFresh], which is what we originally used to make this in the past.

## Ingredients

### Produce

- 1 big stalk scallions  
- 3 limes  
- 3 heads baby lettuce  
- 12 oz red cabbage and carrot mix

### Pantry

- 3 tsp garlic powder  
- 12 oz bulgogi sauce  
- 1.5 oz gochujang sauce  
- 4.5 oz sesame dressing  
- 3 tbsp sesame seeds  
- 3 tsp hot sauce  
- Olive oil  
- Salt & pepper

### Protein

- 60 oz chopped chicken breast

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep

- Wash and dry produce.  
- Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.  
- Halve limes.  
- Trim root end from lettuce and separate leaves.

### Step 2: Cook Chicken

- Drain excess liquid from chicken and season all over with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.  
- Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium‑high heat.  
- Add chicken in a single layer and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through, 4–6 minutes.  
- In the last 30 seconds, add scallion whites and stir to combine.

### Step 3: Start Slaw

- In a medium microwave‑safe bowl, combine cabbage and carrot mix, 1 tsp sugar (2 tsp for 4 servings), and juice from one lime.  
- Season with salt and pepper.  
- Microwave until cabbage is slightly softened, 30–60 seconds.

### Step 4: Sauce Chicken

- Reduce heat under pan to medium‑low.  
- Stir in bulgogi sauce, gochujang, and 2 tbsp water (4 tbsp for 4 servings).  
- Cook, stirring frequently, until sauce thickens and coats the chicken, 1–2 minutes.  
  **TIP:** Add splashes of water if sauce gets too thick.

### Step 5: Finish Slaw

- Add sesame dressing and half the sesame seeds to the cabbage mixture.  
- Toss to combine.

### Step 6: Serve

- Divide lettuce leaves between plates.  
- Fill with sesame slaw, then top with sweet & spicy chicken and any remaining sauce.  
- Garnish with scallion greens and remaining sesame seeds.  
- Drizzle with hot sauce to taste and serve.
