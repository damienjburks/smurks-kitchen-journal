A creamy Dijon chive sauce ties everything together, adding richness without weighing the dish down. This is the kind of recipe you’ll want to keep in your weeknight rotation.

## Ingredients

### Produce

- 24 oz broccoli  
- 3 lemons  
- ¾ oz chives  

### Pantry

- 16.5 oz veggie stock concentrate  
- 36 oz russet potatoes  
- 6 tsp Dijon mustard  
- Olive oil  
- Salt & pepper  

### Dairy

- 9 tbsp sour cream  
- 2 tbsp butter  

### Protein

- 30 oz salmon

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep

- Adjust rack to top position (top and middle for 4 servings) and preheat oven to 450°F.  
- Wash and dry produce.  
- Cut potatoes into ½‑inch‑thick wedges.  
- Cut broccoli into bite‑size pieces if needed.  
- Zest and quarter lemons.  
- Mince chives.

### Step 2: Roast Potatoes

- Toss potatoes on one side of a baking sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper.  
- Roast on top rack for 10 minutes.

### Step 3: Roast Broccoli

- While potatoes roast, toss broccoli with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper.  
- Remove sheet after 10 minutes; add broccoli to the empty side.  
  - For 4 servings, use a second sheet on the middle rack.  
- Return to oven and roast until potatoes are golden and broccoli is lightly browned, 12–15 minutes more.  
- Toss broccoli with lemon zest.

### Step 4: Cook Salmon

- While veggies roast, pat salmon dry and season with salt and pepper.  
- Heat 1 tbsp butter and 1 tbsp olive oil in a large pan over medium‑high heat.  
- Add salmon skin‑side down; cook until skin is crisp and fish is nearly cooked through, 5–7 minutes.  
- Flip and cook until done, 1–2 minutes more.  
- Transfer salmon to a plate and wipe out pan.

### Step 5: Make Sauce

- Return pan to medium‑high heat.  
- Add veggie stock concentrate, half the Dijon mustard, juice from half a lemon, and ¼ cup water (⅓ cup for 4 servings).  
- Simmer until slightly thickened, 2–3 minutes.  
- Turn off heat; stir in sour cream, half the chives, and remaining butter.  
- Season with salt and pepper.  
  **TIP:** Add water 1 tsp at a time if sauce needs thinning.

### Step 6: Serve

- Divide salmon, potatoes, and broccoli between plates.  
- Drizzle sauce over salmon.  
- Garnish with remaining chives and serve with lemon wedges on the side.
