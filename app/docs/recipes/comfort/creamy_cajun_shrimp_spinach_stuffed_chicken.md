## Ingredients

### Produce

- 3 yellow onions  
- 7.5 oz spinach  
- 2 lemons  
- 3 red bell peppers

### Pantry

- 2.25 cups jasmine rice  
- 16.5 oz chicken stock concentrate  
- 3 tbsp Cajun spice blend  
- 3 tsp garlic powder  
- 3 tbsp blackening spice or seasoning  
- Olive oil  
- Salt & pepper

### Dairy

- 18 tbsp cream cheese  
- 9 tbsp Parmesan cheese

### Protein

- 30 oz shrimp

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep & Dirty Rice

- Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450°F.  
- Wash and dry produce. Halve, peel, and finely dice onion. Core and dice bell peppers into ¼-inch pieces. Roughly chop spinach. Quarter lemons.  
- Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a medium pot over high heat. Add onion, bell pepper, and half the blackening spice. Cook, stirring frequently, 2–3 minutes until softened and fragrant.  
- Add jasmine rice, chicken stock concentrate, 1¼ cups water (2¼ cups for 4 servings), and a large pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, cover, then reduce to low heat and simmer until rice is tender, 15–18 minutes. Keep covered off heat.

### Step 2: Cook & Chop Shrimp

- While rice cooks, rinse shrimp under cold water and pat very dry.  
- Season shrimp with Cajun spice blend. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally, until opaque and cooked through, 4–6 minutes.  
- Turn off heat. Transfer shrimp to a plate and allow to cool. Chop half the shrimp and set aside (reserve the rest for Step 6).

### Step 3: Make Filling

- In a medium bowl, combine chopped shrimp, cream cheese, garlic powder, Parmesan cheese, half of the chopped spinach, a pinch of salt, and pepper. Stir until cream cheese is thoroughly incorporated.

### Step 4: Prepare Chicken

- Pat chicken cutlets dry and place between two pieces of plastic wrap. Pound with a mallet or rolling pin until about ¼ inch thick.  
- Season all over with remaining blackening spice, salt, and pepper.  
- Evenly top each cutlet with the shrimp filling. Starting at the bottom, tightly roll up chicken, removing plastic wrap as you go.

### Step 5: Bake

- Place stuffed chicken seam-side down on a baking sheet lined with foil or parchment for easier cleanup.  
- Lightly drizzle olive oil over the chicken and bake on the middle rack until chicken is cooked through and filling is warmed through, 12–15 minutes.  
- Let rest 2 minutes after baking to help the filling stay in place.

### Step 6: Finish Rice & Serve

- Fluff dirty rice with a fork. Stir in remaining whole shrimp and remaining chopped spinach. Taste and season with salt and pepper if desired.  
- Divide rice between plates and top with stuffed chicken. Serve with lemon wedges on the side.
