## Ingredients

### Produce

- 3 lemons  
- 18 oz asparagus  
- 18 oz green beans

### Pantry

- 36 oz potatoes  
- 3 tbsp fry seasoning  
- 4.5 oz honey Dijon dressing  
- Olive oil  
- Salt & pepper

### Dairy

- 1 tbsp butter

### Protein

- 30 oz salmon

## Instructions

### Step 1: Roast Potatoes & Veggies

- Adjust rack to top position (top and middle positions for 4 servings) and preheat oven to 450°F.  
- Wash and dry produce. Cut potatoes into ½‑inch‑thick wedges. Zest and quarter lemons.  
- Toss potatoes on one side of a baking sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil, half the fry seasoning (you’ll use the rest later), salt, and pepper. For 4 servings, spread out across the entire sheet.  
- Roast on the top rack for 10 minutes.

- Trim green beans if needed. After potatoes have roasted 10 minutes, remove sheet from oven.  
- Carefully toss green beans on the opposite side with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper. For 4 servings, leave potatoes roasting and add green beans to a second sheet; roast on the middle rack.  
- Return to top rack and roast until veggies are browned and tender, 12–15 minutes more.  
- Toss roasted green beans with salt, pepper, and lemon zest to taste.

### Step 2: Sear Salmon

- While veggies roast, pat salmon dry with paper towels; season with remaining fry seasoning, salt, and pepper.  
- Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium‑high heat.  
- Add salmon, skin sides down, and cook until browned and crispy, 5–7 minutes.  
- Flip and cook until salmon is opaque and cooked through, 1–2 minutes more.  
- Turn off heat; transfer salmon to a plate. Wipe out the pan.

### Step 3: Make Sauce

- Return the same pan to stovetop over medium heat.  
- Add honey Dijon dressing, 2 tbsp water, and a squeeze of lemon juice.  
- Simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 1–2 minutes.  
- Turn off heat and stir in 1 tbsp butter until melted.  
- Season with salt and pepper to taste.

### Step 4: Serve

- Divide salmon, potatoes, and green beans between plates.  
- Spoon sauce over salmon.  
- Serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side.
